Translations
------------

According to /usr/share/qt4/doc/html/declarative-i18n-i18n-qml.html
the translations must be located in the i18n subdirectory of the root
QML file.

The files are created by running:
  lupdate *.qml */*.qml -ts i18n/base.ts

Translations for new languages are created by copying i18n/base.ts to
i18n/qml_<lang>.ts
The .ts files can then be edited with Linguist:
  linguist i18n/qml_fr.ts

When i18n/qml_fr.ts already exists, it can be updated by running:
  lupdate *.qml */*.qml -ts i18n/qml_fr.ts

The run-time translation files are then generated by running:
  lrelease i18n/*.ts

Finally, we can test the translation:
  qmlviewer -translation i18n/qml_fr.qm main.qml
